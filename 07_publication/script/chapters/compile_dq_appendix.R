# Request:
  # Latest month by HB, number of “known” values (as shown by the heat map)
  # % completeness as above 
  # Publishable status with explanation 


# Outline:

  # fresh dq assessments - work out which checks will need updated for optimised 
  # data, run checks, save
  # load data and filter
  # wrangle as required
  # apply some criterion for 'publishable' 
  
  # "In general terms completeness levels of 95%-98% and over for routine national 
  # datasets would be considered robust enough for Publications." - (p.5, PHS checking guidance)

  # 50% perhaps more realistic due to experimental publication?
