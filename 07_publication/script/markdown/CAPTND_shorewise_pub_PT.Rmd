# Introduction

This publication of statistics in development presents information relating to 
activity in Psychological Therapies (PT) services from the Child, Adolescent, and
Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND), at NHS board and Scotland-level.
Here ‘Scotland-level’ refers to the aggregated regional NHS board figures that are
available in CAPTND.  

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health 
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service. 
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution, and should not be compared 
to the [official aggregate PT collection and waiting times](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/psychological-therapies-waiting-times/psychological-therapies-waiting-times-quarter-ending-march-2025/).  

This report relates to the period `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`.  

## Data Quality

Good quality data are crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and Public Health 
Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement robust data collection for 
CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’, ‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create 
a unique and complete care pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see 
[Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section below). For records where these
key variables are not available the pathway cannot be created accurately and
cannot, therefore, be used in CAPTND analysis. A comparison of referral counts before
and after pathway creation can be found in [Appendix 2 - CAPTND quality assurance](#appendices).  

Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive data quality 
checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality improved sufficiently by 
January 2020 to enable initial and limited reporting to commence.
Improving data quality in CAPTND is an ongoing process, meaning data from previous
quarters may not be comparable to the current reporting period.   

As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on individuals’ journeys 
within PT will be reported.  

## Variables Reported

See the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of terminology and derived values.  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):** An  identifier allocated to new referrals 
to a consultant-led, nurse-led, or other service, to enable identification of
patient pathways. These are only unique *within* NHS boards. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Community Health Index (CHI):** The [Community 
Health Index (CHI)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html)
is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. 
The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index, the first six digits 
of the CHI number relate to the person's date of birth (DD MM YY).
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):** The UPI is a locally-generated code used to
uniquely identify a patient in cases where the CHI number is not available.
</Div>
 
<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Sex:** Biological sex as recorded at birth. 'Not known' refers to indeterminate
sex at birth, including intersex. The use of 'Not specified' refers to instances
where the information is not available.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Age group:** Age in years is calculated at the point of referral from reported date 
of birth. When date of birth is not reported, the first six digits of the CHI 
number are used. Age is then grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**SIMD quintile:** [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/) 
is a postcode-derived measure of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as 
‘deprived’, this can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also 
mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area 
is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access 
to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode area does not 
necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences deprivation. Not all patients 
are treated in their NHS board of residence. Please note that NHS board areas may
not have all five quintiles represented.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Ethnic group:** Ethnic groups were used according to those described in
[Scotland's census 2022](https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/metadata/ethnic-group/#:~:text=Under%20the%20%E2%80%9CWhite%E2%80%9D%20category%2C,African%2C%20Caribbean%20or%20Black%E2%80%9D). These are overarching groupings,
within which multiple related ethnic backgrounds are defined. Referral rates by 
ethnic group were calculated based on [population estimates](https://www.scotlandscensus.gov.uk/webapi/jsf/tableView/tableView.xhtml) 
from Scotland’s 2022 census.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral received date / Referral date:** The date on which a health or social 
care service receives a referral. If this cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is 
used instead as these dates are often very similar. If neither of these fields are
provided the individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within 
the time frame reported.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral accepted:** A categorical variable stating whether an individual's
referral has been accepted, not accepted, decision pending, or the information is missing.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance reason:** The reason why a referral was not accepted 
by the service provider. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance action:** The action taken following an initial referral 
not being accepted into the service. Please note that these are data under development
and may not be recorded in all NHS boards.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment date:** The date on which an appointment occurred or was planned 
to occur. The first appointment date in an individual's pathway is referred to 
as the **first contact appointment.**
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment attendance status:** Indicates whether the patient attended their 
appointment and provides context for non-attendance. This is used to calculate
Did Not Attend (DNA) rates.

# Main Points

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service.
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or conclusions
from this analysis must be treated with caution, and should not be compared to the 
[official aggregate PT collection and waiting times](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/psychological-therapies-waiting-times/psychological-therapies-waiting-times-quarter-ending-march-2025/). 

For the quarter ending `r date_label`:

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
There were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt` people referred to PT and recorded in CAPTND.
This was `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_qt)`%) compared with the
`r figs_referrals$last_qt` referrals in the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of `r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_yr)` 
(`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_yr)`%) compared with the `r figs_referrals$last_yr` referrals
in the same quarter ending `r date_label_yr`.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
PT services across NHSScotland received `r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,3]]`
(`r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,4]]`%) referrals for females and `r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,3]]`
(`r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,4]]`%) for males. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
Of the `r table_data2[[15,2]]` referrals to PT, `r table_data2[[15,3]]`
(`r table_data2[[15,6]]`) were accepted, and deemed suitable for treatment within
the service
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
There were a total of `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt` PT appointments
recorded in CAPTND across NHS Scotland. This was
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_qt)`%)
appointments since the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_yr)`%)
appointments since the same quarter in the previous year.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
Of the total `r ifelse(dataset_choice == "CAMHS", "CAMHS", "PT")` appointments recorded 
across NHSScotland, `r figs_tot_apps[[1,2]]` had an attendance status of 'Did Not Attend (DNA)' 
resulting in a total DNA rate of `r figs_tot_apps[[1,3]] ` for all appointments.

# Results and Commentary
## PT referrals

Table 1 shows the number of people referred to PT
recorded in CAPTND by quarter, for each regional health board and for NHSScotland 
overall.  

For the quarter ending `r date_label`, there were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt`
individuals referred to PT recorded in CAPTND. This was 
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_qt)`%)
compared with the previous quarter, and `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_yr)`%) compared with the same 
quarter ending `r date_label_yr`.  

For some health boards referral numbers may appear to have climbed sharply over the past
five quarters, which may be reflective of improved data quality of submissions allowing
more pathways to be counted in CAPTND, rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.  

CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution. Note that referral
numbers represent those patients for whom it was possible to construct a pathway
in CAPTND, and may therefore be under-representative of total referrals at health
board level. See [Glossary](#glossary) section to explain differences
between Official statistics and Official statistics in development.

## Distribution of PT referrals by age and sex

Figure 1 shows the age distribution and biological sex of people referred to
CAMHS across NHSScotland between `r date_label_5qt` and `r date_label`.
There were `r agesex_total[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[1,4]]`%) females and
`r agesex_total[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[2,4]]`%) males referred over this period.
The sex of the remaining number were recorded as 'not known' or 'not specified'
(see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) for more information).  

The number of referrals for females peaked at age
`r age_peak[[1,4]]` with `r age_peak[[1,5]]` (`r age_peak[[1,7]]`%) of female 
referrals occurring at this age, and for males the most common age at referral was 
`r age_peak[[2,4]]` with `r age_peak[[2,5]]` (`r age_peak[[2,7]]`%) of male referrals.  

In the quarter ending `r date_label`, CAMHS across NHSScotland
received `r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,4]]`%)
referrals for females and `r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,4]]`%)
for males.

```
    
<br>        
    
## Distribution of PT referrals by SIMD quintile

Figure 2 presents the number of people referred to PT services across Scotland by SIMD
quintile, in the quarter ending `r date_label`. `r figs_simd_refs[[1,5]]`
(`r figs_simd_refs[[1,6]]`%) individuals referred to PT
lived in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods across Scotland, whereas
`r figs_simd_refs[[2,5]]` (`r figs_simd_refs[[2,6]]`%) were from the least
deprived 20% of neighbourhoods. See [Variables Reported](#variables-reported)
section for more information.  

This demonstrates that a higher demand for PT services exists in areas of higher deprivation.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 2: Total referrals to PT by SIMD quintile, NHSScotland, quarter ending `r date_label`</Div>
```{r Referrals SIMD chart, fig.width=7.18, fig.height=3.31, include = TRUE}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0("//PHI_conf/MentalHealth5/CAPTND/CAPTND_shorewise/output/analysis_", data_analysis_latest_date, "/shorewise_publication/data/referrals/ref_simd_plot_last_qt_PT.png"))

```
    
<br>        
    
## Distribution of PT referrals by ethnic group

Figure 3 shows the rate of individuals referred to PT services between `r date_label_5qt` 
and `r date_label` per 1,000 population by ethnic group based on Scotland’s 2022 census 
estimates (see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) for further information). These 
analyses are included to aid the monitoring of equity of access, outcomes and inequalities
at a population level.

Due to the small numbers involved, individual ethnic groups have been aggregated 
together based on the high-level Scottish census ethnic group classification 
(see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported)). This analysis, therefore, does not 
show all individual ethnic groups, obscuring these groups' distinct experiences. 
In future, more detailed analyses will be made available where possible.

The group with the highest rate of referrals to PT services for the period between
`r date_label_5qt` and `r date_label` was ‘`r figs_eth_refs [[1,2]]`’ at `r figs_eth_refs [[1,6]]`
per 1,000 population, followed by the ‘`r figs_eth_refs [[2,2]]`’ group at `r figs_eth_refs [[2,6]]`
referrals per 1,000 population. The rate of referrals to PT services for the publication
period was lowest in the ‘`r figs_eth_refs [[6,2]]`’ group, with `r figs_eth_refs [[6,6]]`
referrals per 1,000 population over the publication period. Note any differences observed
between groups will be as a result of multiple factors including the effects of racism on
health and on the social determinants of health.

The rate of referrals where ethnicity is recorded as ‘Not known’ in CAPTND is based on
2022 census data for the total Scottish population. Figure 3 shows that the ethnic group
was recorded as ‘Not known’ for `r eth_not_known[[1,3]]` referrals between `r date_label_5qt`
and `r date_label`. This is equivalent to `r eth_not_known[[1,8]]`% of PT referrals received
during this period. While it may be that those belonging to minority ethnic groups are less
willing to disclose their ethnicity, it is not possible to speculate regarding the ethnic 
composition of those in the 'Not known' category.

## PT referral acceptance

Table 2 shows referral acceptance rates recorded in CAPTND in the latest quarter, 
for each health board and for NHSScotland overall. Data for previous quarters
can be seen in the accompanying [data files]`r paste0("(https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/", dataset_choice, "-in-captnd-2-september-2025/)")`.   

Of the `r table_data2[[15,2]]` referrals to PT in the quarter
ending `r date_label`, the acceptance rate for NHSScotland was `r table_data2[[15,6]]`
(`r table_data2[[15,3]]` accepted referrals).  

The referral acceptance rate in the previous quarter (endings `r date_label_qt`) was
`r figs_ref_acc$last_qt`%, and for the quarter ending `r date_label_yr` it was `r figs_ref_acc$last_yr`%.

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Table 2: Status of referrals to PT by health board, quarter ending `r date_label` ^a,b,c^</Div>

<br>        
    
Figure 4 below shows the reported reason for referral non-acceptance in NHSScotland
for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Please note that these are data under
development and not all NHS boards are currently able to record this information.
This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where non-acceptance reason
was ‘Not recorded at board level’.  

In PT the primary reason for referral non-acceptance was recorded as '
`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,7]]`%)`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]] == "Unsuitable", " - meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for PT because their needs would be better met within another mental health service, e.g. psychiatry", "")`.
The next most common reason for referral non-acceptance was recorded as
'`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,7]]`%)`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]] == "Unsuitable", " - meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for PT because their needs would be better met within another mental health service, e.g. psychiatry.", "")`.

```
    
<br>        
    
Figure 5 shows the actions taken by services following referral non-acceptance in
NHSScotland for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Again, it is important to
note that some NHS boards are not able to record this information at the present
time. This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where the recorded action
was 'not recorded at board level'.

For the records where a non-acceptance action was recorded, however, the majority
of individuals were '`r ref_rej_actions[[1,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_actions[[1,7]]`%),
or  '`r ref_rej_actions[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_actions[[2,7]]`%), meaning the
individual was given further information on where to seek help.

## PT referral source

Figure 6 shows the source of referrals for people referred to PT services across
NHSScotland for the quarter ending `r date_label`. The most common referral source
to PT services was '`r ref_source[[1,4]]`' (`r ref_source[[1,7]]`%), followed by
'`r ref_source[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_source[[2,7]]`%).

```
    
<br>        
    
## PT total appointments

Table 3 shows the total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND for PT in
the latest quarter, for each health board and for NHSScotland overall. Data for
previous quarters can be seen in the accompanying [data files]`r paste0("(https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/", dataset_choice, "-in-captnd-2-september-2025/)")`.  

Across NHSScotland, there were a total of `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt` appointments
recorded in CAPTND for the quarter ending `r date_label`. This was
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_qt)`%)
recorded appointments since the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_yr)`%)
recorded appointments since the same quarter in the previous year.  

The apparent increase in total appointments since `r date_label_5qt` may be
reflective of improved data quality rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.  

The Did Not Attend (DNA) rate is an important measure to consider, as DNA appointments
are difficult to fill due to the unplanned nature of the non-attendance (see
[Glossary](#glossary) section for more information).  Of the `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt`
total appointments in the quarter ending `r date_label`, the overall DNA rate was `r figs_tot_apps[[1,3]]`
(`r figs_tot_apps[[1,2]]` appointments not attended).

## PT appointments by contact location

Figure 7 shows the most common locations in which PT appointments were conducted
across NHSScotland for the quarter ending `r date_label`. By far the most common contact

## PT first contact appointments

Table 4 shows the total number first contact appointments made within PT and
recorded in CAPTND by quarter, for each health board and for NHSScotland overall.
The first contact appointment is the first appointment date a patient is offered
in their treatment journey (see [Glossary](#glossary) section for more information).  

Of the `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt` total appointments in PT in the
latest quarter, `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact appointments"` (`r figs_1st_apps$prop_first_con`)
were first contact appointments.  

The first contact DNA rate is represented as the proportion of all planned first
contact appointments which were not attended. DNAs in first contact appointments
represent a delay to treatment starting. The PT first contact DNA rate across NHSScotland in the
latest quarter was `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact DNA rate"`, representing
`r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact DNA"` of `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact appointments"`
first contact appointments.

Figure 9 shows the first contact DNA rate over the last 15 calendar months, from
`r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`, for each health board region (see [Glossary](#glossary)
section for more information).  

There is some suggestion that the first contact DNA rate is becoming more consistent
between the geographical regions, which is likely due to the improving data quality
in CAPTND. For CAMHS, first contact DNA rates appear highest across the West and North 
regions, with the rate in the East having fallen and stabilised at around 5% since January
2025.

Figure 10 shows the first contact DNA rate for Scotland as a whole in the quarter
ending `r date_label`, broken down by SIMD quintile (see [Variables reported](#variables-reported)
section for more information).  

There are many factors which may influence the DNA rate, of which relative deprivation
could be one. It appears from figure 10 that relative deprivation is correlated with
first contact DNA rate, with individuals from the most deprived areas more likely
to DNA a first contact appointment (`r figs_dna_simd[[1,10]]`%) compared with those from
the least deprived areas (`r figs_dna_simd[[5,10]]`%).

# Glossary  

**Psychological Therapies**  
Psychological Therapies refer to a range of interventions, based on psychological
concepts and theory, which are designed to help people understand and make changes
to their thinking, behaviour, and relationships in order to relieve distress and
to improve functioning. The standard applies specifically to psychological therapies
for treatment of a mental illness or disorder.

**Key variables**  
The combination of identifying variables - including 'UCPN' and 'CHI'/'UPI' -
allowing a patient pathway to be created, which enables further analysis in CAPTND.

**Mean**  
The arithmetical average value i.e. total of a number of values / the total number of 
values.

**Median**  
The middle value when the data values in a dataset are ranked in increasing (or 
decreasing) order of magnitude.

**Total appointments**  
The total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND, whether attended or not. An 
individual can have more than one appointment on a given day.

**First contact appointment**  
The first appointment date that appears in an individual's care pathway.

**DNA Rate**  
Did not attend (DNA) refers to appointments in which a patient did not attend and
gave no prior warning. The DNA rate is the proportion of appointments for which
this occurs out of all appointments in a given period. If for first contact appointments only this
is referred to as the *first contact DNA rate*.

**Region**  
The health boards that make up NHSScotland can be divided into three geographical
regions:  
East region: *Borders, Fife, Lothian*  
North region: *Highland, Grampian, Orkney, Tayside, Western Isles, Shetland*  
West region: *Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Dumfries & Galloway*  

**Official statistics/Official statistics in development:**  
[Official statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/glossary/#pid-official-statistics)
are statistics produced on behalf of the UK government, while [official statistics in development](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/glossary/#pid-official-statistics-in-development)
are official statistics which are undergoing a development, and are under testing
by users for quality, trustworthiness, and value.

# Appendices
## Appendix 1 - Background information

In 2019, an official letter was shared with all NHS Chief Executives and Chief
Officers. This letter stated that the focus on Mental Health (MH) continues to grow.
This brings with it increased demand for services, and a need for a robust evidence
base to support health boards and integrated joint boards (IJBs), where children’s
services are integrated, in effective planning and monitoring.  

One key component of the evidence base is the information health boards gather on adults,
children and young people who receive treatment through CAMHS or PT services. In
order to improve these data, the Scottish Government commissioned ISD (now PHS) to
work with Boards to develop an individual level core dataset (CAPTND).
CAPTND data are still at an experimental stage therefore any inferences or
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution.
