# Introduction

This publication of statistics in development presents information relating to 
activity in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)
from the Child, Adolescent, and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND), 
at NHS board and Scotland-level. Here ‘Scotland-level’ refers to the aggregated
regional NHS board figures that are available in CAPTND.  

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health 
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service. 
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution, and should not be compared 
to the [official aggregate CAMHS collection and waiting times](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-waiting-times-quarter-ending-september-2025/).  

This report relates to the period `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`.  

## Data Quality

Good quality data are crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and Public Health 
Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement robust data collection for 
CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’, ‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create 
a unique and complete care pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see 
[Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section below). For records where these
key variables are not available the pathway cannot be created accurately and
cannot, therefore, be used in CAPTND analysis. A comparison of referral counts before
and after pathway creation can be found in the accompanying [data quality document](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-in-child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-3-march-2026/). 

Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive data quality 
checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality improved sufficiently by 
January 2020 to enable initial and limited reporting to commence.
Improving data quality in CAPTND is an ongoing process, meaning data from previous
quarters may not be comparable to the current reporting period.   

As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on individuals’ journeys 
within CAMHS will be reported.  

## Variables Reported

See the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of terminology and derived values.  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):** An  identifier allocated to new referrals 
to a consultant-led, nurse-led, or other service, to enable identification of
patient pathways. These are only unique *within* NHS boards. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Community Health Index (CHI):** The [Community 
Health Index (CHI)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html)
is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. 
The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index, the first six digits 
of the CHI number relate to the person's date of birth (DD MM YY).
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):** The UPI is a locally-generated code used to
uniquely identify a patient in cases where the CHI number is not available.
</Div>
 
<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Sex:** Biological sex as recorded at birth. 'Not known' refers to indeterminate
sex at birth, including intersex. The use of 'Not specified' refers to instances
where the information is not available.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Age group:** Age in years is calculated at the point of referral from reported date 
of birth. When date of birth is not reported, the first six digits of the CHI 
number are used. Age is then grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.  
NB: CAMHS is available for children and young people aged 0-18 in Scotland (for those who meet referral criteria). In some cases, however, individuals over 18 may access CAMHS.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**SIMD quintile:** [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/) 
is a postcode-derived measure of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as 
‘deprived’, this can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also 
mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area 
is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access 
to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode area does not 
necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences deprivation. Not all patients 
are treated in their NHS board of residence. Please note that NHS board areas may
not have all five quintiles represented.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Looked after child status:** An indication of whether the individual is *currently*
a looked after child.  
This can be:  
a) In local authority accommodation under a voluntary arrangement, where the child's
parents agree to the child being accommodated.  
b) In local authority accommodation or at home, under compulsory measures decided
by a children's hearing or a court.  
The local authority has responsibilities and duties towards a child who is being
'looked after' under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Child protection status:** An indication of whether the individual is *currently*
on the Child Protection Register. Local authorities are responsible for maintaining
this confidential central register of all children and young people who are the subject
of a multi-agency Child Protection Plan. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral received date / Referral date:** The date on which a health or social 
care service receives a referral. If this cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is 
used instead as these dates are often very similar. If neither of these fields are
provided the individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within 
the time frame reported.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral accepted:** A categorical variable stating whether an individual's
referral has been accepted, not accepted, decision pending, or the information is missing.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance reason:** The reason why a referral was not accepted 
by the service provider. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance action:** The action taken following an initial referral 
not being accepted into the service. Please note that these are data under development
and may not be recorded in all NHS boards.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment date:** The date on which an appointment occurred or was planned 
to occur. The first appointment date in an individual's pathway is referred to 
as the **first contact appointment.**
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment attendance status:** Indicates whether the patient attended their 
appointment and provides context for non-attendance. This is used to calculate
Did Not Attend (DNA) rates.

# Results and Commentary
## CAMHS referrals

For the quarter ending `r date_label`, there were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt`
children and young people referred to CAMHS recorded in CAPTND. This was 
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_qt)`%)
compared with the previous quarter, and `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_yr)`%) compared with the same 
quarter ending `r date_label_yr` (Table 1).  

For some health boards, referral numbers may appear to have increased sharply over the past
five quarters, which may be reflective of improved data quality of submissions allowing
more pathways to be counted in CAPTND, rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.  

CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution. Note that referral
numbers represent those patients for whom it was possible to construct a pathway
in CAPTND, and may therefore be under-representative of total referrals at health
board level. See [Glossary](#glossary) section to explain differences
between Official statistics and Official statistics in development. CAMHS are 
multi-disciplinary teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children 
and young people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young
person is waiting on an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition, such as 
autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
they may not meet the national referral criteria as set out in the [CAMHS national service specification](https://www.gov.scot/publications/child-adolescent-mental-health-services-camhs-nhs-scotland-national-service-specification/pages/1/) and therefore will not be counted in these statistics. 
PHS is commissioned to collect information on CAMHS, excluding ND pathway activity. 

This release does not report on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those
children and young people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list. Please see the ND 
activity section of the accompanying [data quality document](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-in-child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-3-march-2026/), and the [national neurodevelopmental specification: principles and standards of care](https://www.gov.scot/publications/national-neurodevelopmental-specification-children-young-people-principles-standards-care/) for more information.

## Distribution of CAMHS referrals by age and sex

Figure 1 shows the age distribution and biological sex of people referred to
CAMHS across NHS Scotland between `r date_label_5qt` and `r date_label`.
There were `r agesex_total[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[1,4]]`%) females and
`r agesex_total[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[2,4]]`%) males referred to CAMHS across 
NHS Scotland between `r date_label_5qt` and `r date_label`, with the remainder 
(`r agesex_total[[3,4]]`%) recorded as 'not known' or 'not specified' (Figure 1)
(see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) for more information). 

The number of referrals for females peaked at age
`r age_peak[[1,4]]` with `r age_peak[[1,5]]` (`r age_peak[[1,7]]`%) of female 
referrals occurring at this age, and for males the most common age at referral was 
`r age_peak[[2,4]]` with `r age_peak[[2,5]]` (`r age_peak[[2,7]]`%) of male referrals.  

In the quarter ending `r date_label`, CAMHS across NHS Scotland
received `r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,4]]`%)
referrals for females and `r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,4]]`%)
for males.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 1: Age distribution of CAMHS referrals by sex, NHS Scotland, from `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`</Div>
```{r Referrals sex & age chart, fig.width=7.18, fig.height=3.31, include = TRUE}

```

## Distribution of CAMHS referrals by SIMD quintile

`r figs_simd_refs[[1,5]]` (`r figs_simd_refs[[1,6]]`%) individuals referred to CAMHS, 
in the quarter ending `r date_label`, lived in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods 
across Scotland, whereas `r figs_simd_refs[[2,5]]` (`r figs_simd_refs[[2,6]]`%) were 
from the least deprived 20% of neighbourhoods (Figure 2). See [Variables Reported](#variables-reported)
section for more information.  

This demonstrates that a higher demand for CAMHS exists in areas of higher deprivation.

```

## Looked after child and child protection status of CAMHS referrals

Figure 3 shows the looked after child status of individuals referred to CAMHS services
in NHS Scotland, for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Of the `r ref_lac[[1,6]]`
CAMHS referrals in the latest quarter, `r ref_lac[[1,5]]` (`r ref_lac[[1,7]]`%)
individuals were currently considered to be a looked after child.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 3: Looked after child status of CAMHS referrals, NHS Scotland, quarter ending `r date_label`</Div>

```

Figure 4 shows the Child Protection status of individuals referred to CAMHS services
in NHS Scotland, for the quarter ending `r date_label`. There were `r ref_child_prot[[1,5]]`
(`r ref_child_prot[[1,7]]`%) individuals referred to CAMHS across NHS Scotland
currently considered to be on the Child Protection Register for the most recent
quarter. The Child Protection status of `r ref_child_prot[[3,5]]` (`r ref_child_prot[[3,7]]`%)
individuals was either missing or not known.

```


## CAMHS referral acceptance

Of the `r table_data2[[15,2]]` referrals to CAMHS in the quarter
ending `r date_label`, the acceptance rate for NHS Scotland was `r table_data2[[15,6]]`
(`r table_data2[[15,3]]` accepted referrals) (Table 2). Data for previous quarters
can be seen in the accompanying [data files](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-in-child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-3-march-2026/).     

The referral acceptance rate in the previous quarter (ending `r date_label_qt`) was
`r figs_ref_acc$last_qt`%, and for the quarter ending `r date_label_yr` it was
`r figs_ref_acc$last_yr`%. This suggests that the referral acceptance rate across
CAMHS has declined over the reporting period.

Figure 5 below shows the reported reason for referral non-acceptance in NHS Scotland
for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Please note that these are data under
development and not all NHS boards are currently able to record this information.
This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where non-acceptance reason
was ‘Not recorded at board level’.  

In CAMHS the primary reason for referral non-acceptance was recorded as
'`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,7]]`%)`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]] == "Unsuitable", " - meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for CAMHS because they may not meet the national referral criteria for CAMHS, therefore their needs would be better met within another mental health service, e.g. neurodevelopmental services", "")`.
The next most common reason for referral non-acceptance was recorded as
'`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,7]]`%)`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]] == "Unsuitable", " - meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for CAMHS because their needs would be better met within another mental health service, e.g. neurodevelopmental services.", "")`.

```
<br>

Figure 6 shows the actions taken by services following referral non-acceptance in
NHS Scotland for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Again, it is important to
note that some NHS boards are not able to record this information at the present
time. This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where the recorded action
was 'not recorded at board level'.  

For records where a non-acceptance action was recorded,
the majority of individuals were '`r ref_rej_actions[[1,4]]`'
(`r ref_rej_actions[[1,7]]`%), meaning the individual was given further information on where to seek help, or '`r ref_rej_actions[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_actions[[2,7]]`%).

```

## CAMHS referral source

The most common referral source to CAMHS services, across NHS Scotland for the quarter
ending `r date_label`, was '`r ref_source[[1,4]]`' (`r ref_source[[1,7]]`%), followed by
'`r ref_source[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_source[[2,7]]`%) (Figure 7).

```

## CAMHS total appointments

Across NHS Scotland, there were a total of `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt` appointments
recorded in CAPTND for the quarter ending `r date_label`. This was
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_qt)`%)
recorded appointments since the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_yr)`%)
recorded appointments since the same quarter in the previous year (Table 3). Data for
previous quarters can be seen in the accompanying
[data files](https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/child-and-adolescent-mental-health-services-in-child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-3-march-2026/).    

The apparent increase in total appointments since `r date_label_5qt` may be
reflective of improved data quality rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.  

The Did Not Attend (DNA) rate is an important measure to consider, as DNA appointments
are difficult to fill due to the unplanned nature of the non-attendance (see
[Glossary](#glossary) section for more information). Of the `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt`
total appointments in the quarter ending `r date_label`, the overall DNA rate was `r figs_tot_apps[[1,3]]`
(`r figs_tot_apps[[1,2]]` appointments not attended).

## CAMHS appointments by contact location

The most common location in which CAMHS appointments were conducted
across NHS Scotland for the quarter ending `r date_label` was '`r appt_loc[[1,3]]`' 
(`r appt_loc[[1,7]]`%), followed by '`r appt_loc[[3,3]]`' (`r appt_loc[[3,7]]`%).

## CAMHS first contact appointments

Of the `r figs_apps_qt$current_qt` total appointments in CAMHS across NHS Scotland in the
latest quarter, `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact appointments"` (`r figs_1st_apps$prop_first_con`)
were first contact appointments (Table 4). The first contact appointment is the first 
appointment date a patient is offered in their treatment journey 
(see [Glossary](#glossary) section for more information).  

The first contact DNA rate is represented as the proportion of all planned first
contact appointments which were not attended. DNAs in first contact appointments
represent a delay to treatment starting. The CAMHS first contact DNA rate across NHS Scotland in the
latest quarter was `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact DNA rate"`, representing
`r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact DNA"` of `r figs_1st_apps$"1st contact appointments"`
first contact appointments.

The first contact DNA rate for CAMHS has shown variability between geographic 
regions over the publication period from `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`. 
First contact DNA rates have typically been highest across the West. This region has also 
seen greater consistency in the rates recorded over the 15 month period published 
compared to the other health board regions. The increase in first contact DNA rates 
in the East from September 2025 onwards is likely attributable to changes in methodologies
used to extract data at board level in NHS Lothian, rather than reflecting a true increase 
in patient non-attendance. Since September 2025, first contact DNA rates across health 
board regions have tracked at very similar rates month to month (Figure 10) 
(see [Glossary](#glossary) section for more information).

There are many factors which may influence the DNA rate, of which relative deprivation
may be one. Individuals from the most deprived areas were more likely
to DNA a first contact appointment (`r figs_dna_simd[[1,10]]`%) compared with those from
the least deprived areas (`r figs_dna_simd[[5,10]]`%) across NHS Scotland for the 
quarter ending `r date_label` (Figure 11) (see [Variables reported](#variables-reported)

# Glossary  

**CAMHS**  
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services provided by NHS Scotland. Services
are provided by teams of clinicians including psychiatrists, mental health nurses,
clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals.
These services are based mainly in outpatient clinics and in the community. CAMHS
are multi-disciplinary teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children
and young people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young person
is awaiting an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition such as ASD, or ADHD,
they may not be appropriate for CAMHS. This is because they do not meet the National Referral
Criteria as described in the CAMHS national service specification and may instead
be referred onto a neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway. This release does not report
on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those children and young people
on the neurodevelopmental waiting list.

**Children and young people**  
The people served by CAMHS. Some areas provide services for all those under 18, 
while others offer services to those over 16 only if they are in full time education.

**Key variables**  
The combination of identifying variables - including 'UCPN' and 'CHI'/'UPI' -
allowing a patient pathway to be created, which enables further analysis in CAPTND.

**Mean**  
The arithmetical average value i.e. total of a number of values / the total number of 
values.

**Median**  
The middle value when the data values in a dataset are ranked in increasing (or 
decreasing) order of magnitude.

**Total appointments**  
The total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND, whether attended or not. An 
individual can have more than one appointment on a given day.

**First contact appointment**  
The first appointment date that appears in an individual's care pathway.

**DNA Rate**  
Did not attend (DNA) refers to appointments in which a patient did not attend and
gave no prior warning. The DNA rate is the proportion of appointments for which
this occurs out of all appointments in a given period. If for first contact appointments only this
is referred to as the *first contact DNA rate*.

**Region**  
The health boards that make up NHS Scotland can be divided into three geographical
regions:  
East region: *Borders, Fife, Lothian*  
North region: *Highland, Grampian, Orkney, Tayside, Western Isles, Shetland*  
West region: *Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Dumfries & Galloway*  

**Official statistics/Official statistics in development:**  
[Official statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/glossary/#pid-official-statistics)
are statistics produced on behalf of the UK government, while [official statistics in development](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/glossary/#pid-official-statistics-in-development)
are official statistics which are undergoing a development, and are under testing
by users for quality, trustworthiness, and value.

# Appendices
## Appendix 1 - Background information

In 2019, an official letter was shared with all NHS Chief Executives and Chief
Officers. This letter stated that the focus on Mental Health (MH) continues to grow.
This brings with it increased demand for services, and a need for a robust evidence
base to support health boards and integrated joint boards (IJBs), where children’s
services are integrated, in effective planning and monitoring.  

One key component of the evidence base is the information health boards gather on adults,
children and young people who receive treatment through CAMHS or PT services. In
order to improve these data, the Scottish Government commissioned ISD (now PHS) to
work with Boards to develop an individual level core dataset (CAPTND).
CAPTND data are still at an experimental stage therefore any inferences or
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution.
