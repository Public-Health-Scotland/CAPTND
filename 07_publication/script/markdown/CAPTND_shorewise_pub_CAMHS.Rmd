# Introduction

This publication of statistics in development presents information relating to 
activity in Child and Adolescent Mental Health services (CAMHS)
from the Child, Adolescent, and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND), 
at NHS board and Scotland-level. Here ‘Scotland-level’ refers to the aggregated
regional NHS board figures that are available in CAPTND.  

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health 
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service. 
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution.  

This report relates to the period `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`.  

## Data Quality

Good quality data are crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and Public Health 
Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement robust data collection for 
CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’, ‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create 
a unique and complete care pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see 
[Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section below). For records where these
key variables are not available the pathway cannot be created accurately and
cannot, therefore, be used in CAPTND analysis. A comparison of referral counts before
and after pathway creation can be found in [Appendix 2](#appendix-2-captnd-quality-assurance) 
section below.  

Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive data quality 
checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality improved sufficiently by 
January 2020 to enable initial and limited reporting to commence.
Improving data quality in CAPTND is an ongoing process, meaning data from previous
quarters may not be comparable to the current reporting period.   

As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on individuals’ journeys 
within CAMHS will be reported.  

## Variables Reported

See the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of terminology and derived values.  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):** An  identifier allocated to new referrals 
to a consultant-led, nurse-led, or other service, to enable identification of
patient pathways. These are only unique *within* NHS boards. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Community Health Index (CHI):** The [Community 
Health Index (CHI)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html)
is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. 
The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index, the first six digits 
of the CHI number relate to the person's date of birth (DD MM YY).
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):** The UPI is a locally-generated code used to
uniquely identify a patient in cases where the CHI number is not available.
</Div>
 
<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Sex:** Biological sex as recorded at birth. 'Not known' refers to indeterminate
sex at birth, including intersex. The use of 'Not specified' refers to instances
where the information is not available.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Age group:** Age in years is calculated at the point of referral from reported date 
of birth. When date of birth is not reported, the first six digits of the CHI 
number are used. Age is then grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.  
NB: CAMHS is available for children and young people aged 0-18 in Scotland (for those who meet referral criteria). In some cases, however, individuals over 18 may access CAMHS.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**SIMD quintile:** [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/) 
is a postcode-derived measure of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as 
‘deprived’, this can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also 
mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area 
is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access 
to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode area does not 
necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences deprivation. Not all patients 
are treated in their NHS board of residence. Please note that NHS board areas may
not have all five quintiles represented.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral received date / Referral date:** The date on which a health or social 
care service receives a referral. If this cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is 
used instead as these dates are often very similar. If neither of these fields are
provided the individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within 
the time frame reported.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral accepted:** A categorical variable stating whether an individual's
referral has been accepted, not accepted, decision pending, or the information is missing.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance reason:** The reason why a referral was not accepted 
by the service provider. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance action:** The action taken following an initial referral 
not being accepted into the service. Please note that these are data under development
and may not be recorded in all NHS boards.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment date:** The date on which an appointment occurred or was planned 
to occur. The first appointment date in an individual's pathway is referred to 
as the **first contact appointment.**
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment attendance status:** Indicates whether the patient attended their 
appointment and provides context for non-attendance. This is used to calculate
Did Not Attend (DNA) rates.
</Div>

# Results and Commentary
## CAMHS referrals

Table 1 shows the number of people referred to CAMHS
recorded in CAPTND by quarter, for each regional health board and for NHSScotland 
overall.  

For the quarter ending `r date_label`, there were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt`
children and young people referred to CAMHS recorded in CAPTND. This was 
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_qt)`%)
compared with the previous quarter, and `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_yr)`%) compared with the same 
quarter ending `r date_label_yr`.  

For some boards referral numbers may appear to have climbed sharply over the past
five quarters, which may be reflective of improved data quality of submissions allowing
more pathways to be counted in CAPTND, rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.  

CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution. Note that referral
numbers represent those patients for whom it was possible to construct a pathway
in CAPTND, and may therefore be under-representative of total referrals at health
board level. See [Glossary](#glossary) section to explain differences
between Official statistics and Official statistics in development.

## Distribution of CAMHS referrals by age and sex

Figure 1 shows the age distribution and biological sex of people referred to
CAMHS across NHSScotland between `r date_label_5qt` and `r date_label`.
There were `r agesex_total[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[1,4]]`%) females and
`r agesex_total[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total[[2,4]]`%) males referred over this period.
The sex of the remaining number were recorded as 'not known' or 'not specified' 
(see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) for more information).
The number of referrals for females peaked at aged
`r age_peak[[1,4]]` with `r age_peak[[1,5]]` (`r age_peak[[1,7]]`%) referrals, and
for males the most common age was `r age_peak[[2,4]]` with `r age_peak[[2,5]]`
(`r age_peak[[2,7]]`%) referrals.

In the quarter ending `r date_label`, CAMHS across NHSScotland
received `r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[1,4]]`%)
referrals for females and `r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,3]]` (`r agesex_total_last_qt[[2,4]]`%)
for males.

```

## Distribution of CAMHS referrals by SIMD quintile

Figure 2 presents the number of people referred to CAMHS across Scotland by SIMD
quintile, in the quarter ending `r date_label`. `r figs_simd_refs[[1,5]]`
(`r figs_simd_refs[[1,6]]`%) individuals referred to CAMHS
lived in the most deprived 20% of neighbourhoods across Scotland, whereas
`r figs_simd_refs[[2,5]]` (`r figs_simd_refs[[2,6]]`%) were from the least
deprived 20% of neighbourhoods. See [Variables Reported](#variables-reported)
section for more information.  

This demonstrates that a higher demand for CAMHS exists in areas of higher deprivation.

## Looked after child and child protection status of CAMHS referrals

Figure x shows the looked after child status of individuals referred to CAMHS services
in NHSScotland, for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Of the `r figs_referrals$current_qt` 
CAMHS referrals in the latest quarter, `r ref_lac[[1,5]]` (`r ref_lac[[1,7]]`%) 
individuals were currently considered to be a looked after child.

```

Figure x shows the Child Protection status of individuals referred to CAMHS services
in NHSScotland, for the quarter ending `r date_label`. There were `r ref_child_prot[[1,5]]` 
(`r ref_child_prot[[1,7]]`%) individuals referred to CAMHS across NHSScotland 
currently considered to be on the Child Protection Register for the most recent 
quarter. The Child Protection status of `r ref_child_prot[[4,5]]` (`r ref_child_prot[[4,7]]`%) 
individuals was missing.

## CAMHS referral acceptance

Table 2 shows referral acceptance rates recorded in CAPTND in the latest quarter, 
for each health board and for NHSScotland overall. Data for previous quarters
can be seen in the accompanying [data files]`r paste0("(https://publichealthscotland.scot/publications/child-adolescent-and-psychological-therapies-national-dataset-captnd/", dataset_choice, "-in-captnd-3-september-2024/)")`.   

Of the `r table_data2[[15,2]]` referrals to CAMHS in the quarter
ending `r date_label`, the acceptance rate for NHSScotland was `r table_data2[[15,6]]`
(`r table_data2[[15,3]]` accepted referrals).  

The referral acceptance rate in the previous quarter (endings `r date_label_qt`) was
`r figs_ref_acc$last_qt`%, and for the quarter ending `r date_label_yr` it was `r figs_ref_acc$last_yr`%.
This shows that the referral acceptance rate across CAMHS has remained fairly stable over time.

Figure 3 below shows the reported reason for referral non-acceptance in NHSScotland
for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Please note that these are data under
development and not all NHS boards are currently able to record this information.
This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where non-acceptance reason
was ‘Not recorded at board level’.  

In CAMHS the primary reason for referral non-acceptance was recorded as '`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]]`'
`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]] == "Unsuitable", "- meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for CAMHS because their needs would be better met in another branch of mental health services, e.g. neurodevelopmental services.", "")` (`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,7]]`%). The next most common reason for
referral non-acceptance was recorded as '`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]]`'
`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]] == "Unsuitable", "- meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred. A patient may be deemed unsuitable for CAMHS because their needs would be better met in another branch of mental health services, e.g. neurodevelopmental services.", "")` (`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,7]]`%).

Figure 4 shows the actions taken by services following referral non-acceptance in
NHSScotland for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Again, it is important to
note that some NHS boards are not able to record this information at the present
time. This accounts for the high proportion of referrals where the recorded action
was 'not recorded at board level'.

For the records where a non-acceptance action was recorded, however, 
the majority of individuals are '`r ref_rej_actions[[1,4]]`' 
(`r ref_rej_actions[[1,7]]`%), or  '`r ref_rej_actions[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_actions[[2,7]]`%), 
meaning the individual was given further information on where to seek help.

(`r prof_group[[1,7]]`%), followed by '`r prof_group[[2,3]]`' 
(`r prof_group[[2,7]]`%). Professional group data was missing for

```

## CAMHS appointment attendance

Table 3 shows the total number of appointments made within CAMHS and recorded 
in CAPTND by quarter, for each health board and for NHSScotland overall. Total
appointments include first contact appointments (see [Glossary](#glossary) section
for more information) and return appointments. Across NHSScotland, there were a
total of `r figs_apps$"Total appointments"` appointments recorded in CAPTND for the
quarter ending `r date_label`. This was `r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_qt)`%)
recorded appointments since the previous quarter, and `r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_yr)`%)
recorded appointments since the same quarter in the previous year.

The apparent increase in total appointments since `r date_label_5qt` may be
reflective of improved data quality rather than necessarily representing an actual
increase in service demand.

Of the `r figs_apps$"Total appointments"` CAMHS appointments in the
latest quarter, `r figs_apps$"1st contact appointments"` (`r figs_apps$prop_first_con`%) 
were first contact appointments.  

The Did Not Attend (DNA) rate is an important measure to consider, as DNA appointments
are difficult to fill due to the unplanned nature of the non-attendance (see 
[Glossary](#glossary) section for more information). This document reports on the
DNA rate as the proportion of all planned first contact appointments which were not attended.  

As the DNA rate is for first contact appointments, this also represents a delay
to treatment start time. The CAMHS DNA rate across NHSScotland in the
latest quarter was `r figs_apps$"1st contact DNA rate"`%, representing
`r figs_apps$"1st contact DNA"` of `r figs_apps$"1st contact appointments"` 
first contact appointments.

Figure 5 shows the DNA rate over the last 15 calendar months, from `r date_label_5qt`
to `r date_label`, for each health board region (see [Glossary](#glossary) 
section for more information).  

The DNA rate for CAMHS appears reasonably stable, both between the geographical regions and across time. The greater variability apparent in the earlier months' data is likely to be attributable to poorer historical data quality in CAPTND.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 5: First contact DNA rate by health board region, `r date_label_5qt` to `r date_label`</Div>

```
<br>

Figure 6 shows the first contact DNA rate for Scotland as a whole in the quarter 
ending `r date_label`, broken down by SIMD quintile (see [Variables reported](#variables-reported) 
section for more information).  

There are many factors which may influence the DNA rate, of which relative deprivation
could be one. It appears from figure 6 that relative deprivation can affect the DNA rate,
with individuals from the most deprived areas more likely to DNA a first contact
appointment (`r figs_dna_simd[[1,10]]`%) than those from the least deprived areas
(`r figs_dna_simd[[5,10]]`%).

# Glossary  

**CAMHS**  
Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services provided by NHS Scotland. Services are provided by teams of clinicians including psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals. These services are based mainly in outpatient clinics and in the community. CAMHS are multi-disciplinary teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children and young people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young person is awaiting an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition such as ASD, or ADHD, they may not be appropriate for CAMHS because they do not meet the National Referral Criteria as described in the CAMHS national service specification, and may instead be referred onto a neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway. This release does not report on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those children and young people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list.

**Children and young people**  
The people served by CAMHS. Some areas provide services for all those under 18, 
while others offer services to those over 16 only if they are in full time education.

**Key variables**  
The combination of identifying variables - including 'UCPN' and 'CHI'/'UPI' -
allowing a patient pathway to be created, which enables further analysis in CAPTND.

**Mean**  
The arithmetical average value i.e. total of a number of values / the total number of 
values.

**Median**  
The middle value when the data values in a dataset are ranked in increasing (or 
decreasing) order of magnitude.

**Total appointments**  
The total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND, whether attended or not. An 
individual can have more than one appointment on a given day.

**First contact appointment**  
The first appointment date that appears in an individual's care pathway.

**DNA Rate**  
Did not attend (DNA) refers to first contact appointments in which a patient did 
not attend and gave no prior warning. The DNA rate is the proportion of first 
contact appointments for which this occurs out of all first contact appointments.

**Region**  
The health boards that make up NHSScotland can be divided into three geographical
regions:  
East region: *Borders, Fife, Lothian*  
North region: *Highland, Grampian, Orkney, Tayside, Western Isles, Shetland*  
West region: *Ayrshire & Arran, Greater Glasgow & Clyde, Lanarkshire, Forth Valley, Dumfries & Galloway*  

**Official statistics/Official statistics in development:**

# Appendices
## Appendix 1 - Background information

In 2019, an official letter was shared with all NHS Chief Executives and Chief
Officers. This letter stated that the focus on Mental Health (MH) continues to grow.
This brings with it increased demand for services, and a need for a robust evidence
base to support health boards and integrated joint boards (IJBs), where children’s
services are integrated, in effective planning and monitoring.  

One key component of the evidence base is the information health boards gather on adults,
children and young people who receive treatment through CAMHS or PT services. In
order to improve these data, the Scottish Government commissioned ISD (now PHS) to
work with Boards to develop an individual level core dataset (CAPTND).
CAPTND data are still at an experimental stage therefore any inferences or
conclusions from this analysis must be treated with caution.  

\newpage

## Appendix 2 - CAPTND quality assurance

```{r Data for inline values - basic v opti, include = FALSE}
# for basic v opti section
figs_basic_opti <- table_data4 |> 
  filter(`Health board` == "NHS Scotland") |> 
  select(-`Health board`) |> 
  mutate(across(everything(),~ gsub("-", "", .))) # just removing - sign
```

The CAPTND dataset relies upon CHI / UPI and UCPN identifiers to accurately
track an individual’s care pathway in CAMHS. In the absence of
these key variables, the pathway cannot be created in CAPTND.  

Table 4 presents a comparison of total referral counts in CAMHS
submitted to CAPTND, against the number of those pathways which can be counted
using the key variables This is shown at Scotland level as well as by individual
health board for the quarter ending `r date_label`.  

In the quarter ending `r date_label`, a total of `r figs_basic_opti[[1,1]]`
referrals to CAMHS were submitted to CAPTND, however,
`r figs_basic_opti$"Percent difference"` did not include the key variables,
and therefore a pathway could not be created, hindering further analysis in CAPTND.
As we can see from Table 4, this figure varies between health boards, with several
boards supplying the necessary key variables for all of their referrals,
enabling 100% of them to be counted in CAPTND. In health boards where the
pathway count was lower, this tends to be due to issues around the health board's
ability to record all of the required key variables, and we expect this
will improve over time with ongoing data quality assessment and development.
