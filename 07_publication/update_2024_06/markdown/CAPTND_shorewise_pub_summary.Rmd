# About this release
This statistics in development release by Public Health Scotland (PHS) provides
an update on information relating to activity in `r dataset_label` (`r dataset_choice`)
`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", "services", "")` from the Child, Adolescent,
and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND) in NHSScotland, for the
quarter ending `r date_label`.

# Main Points
CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health
services at patient-level and records each individualâ€™s journey through the service.
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or conclusions
from this analysis must be treated with caution.  

For `r dataset_choice` in the quarter ending `r date_label`:  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
There were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt`
`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "CAMHS", "children and young people", "people")` 
referred to `r dataset_choice` and recorded in CAPTND.
This was `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_qt)`%) compared with the
`r figs_referrals$last_qt` referrals in the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of `r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$diff_yr)` 
(`r gsub("-", "", figs_referrals$prop_yr)`%) compared with the `r figs_referrals$last_yr` referrals
in the same quarter ending `r date_label_yr`.

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
Of the `r table_data2[[15,2]]` referrals to `r dataset_choice`, `r table_data2[[15,3]]`
(`r table_data2[[15,6]]`) were accepted. Of the `r table_data2[[15,4]]` referrals
not accepted, `r ref_rej_reasons[[1,5]]` (`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,7]]`%) were due
to the individual referred being unsuitable for treatment in `r dataset_choice`
`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", " services", "")`.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1">
There were a total of `r table_data3[[15,2]]` `r dataset_choice` appointments recorded in CAPTND 
across NHS Scotland. This is `r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")`
of `r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_qt)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_qt)`%)
recorded appointments since the previous quarter, and
`r ifelse(figs_apps_qt$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of
`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$diff_yr)` (`r gsub("-", "", figs_apps_qt$prop_yr)`%)
recorded appointments since the same quarter in the previous year.

# Background

Waiting times information for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) and 
psychological therapies using CAPTND is still being developed. NHS health boards
are working with PHS and the Scottish Government to improve the consistency and
completeness of the 
information.  

`r if(dataset_choice == "CAMHS"){

"CAMHS are multi-disciplinary teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children and
young people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young person is waiting
for an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition such as ASD, or ADHD, they may not be
appropriate for CAMHS. This release does not report on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway
including those children and young people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list."

}else{

"Psychological therapies refer to a range of interventions, based on psychological concepts and
theory, which are designed to help people understand and make changes to their thinking,
behaviour and relationships in order to relieve distress and to improve functioning. The standard
applies specifically to psychological therapies for treatment of a mental illness or disorder."
