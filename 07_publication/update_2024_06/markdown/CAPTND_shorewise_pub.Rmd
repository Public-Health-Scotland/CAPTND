# Introduction

This publication of statistics in development presents information relating to 
activity in `r dataset_label_long` `r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", "services", "")`
from the Child, Adolescent, and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND), 
at NHS board and Scotland-level. Here ‘Scotland-level’ refers to the aggregated
regional NHS board figures that are available in CAPTND.  

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health 
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service. 
CAPTND data are still at an experimental stage therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis should be treated with caution.  

This report relates to the period `r date_label_15m` to `r date_label`.  

## Data Quality

Good quality data is crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and Public Health 
Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement robust data collection for 
CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’, ‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create 
a unique and complete care pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section below). For records where these variables 
are not available, the pathway cannot be created and is therefore not counted 
in the CAPTND dataset. A comparison of referral counts before and after pathway 
creation can be found in the [CAPTND Quality Assurance](#captnd-quality-assurance) 
section below.  

Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive data quality 
checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality improved sufficiently by 
January 2020 to enable reporting to commence thereafter. Improving data quality 
in CAPTND is an ongoing process, meaning data from previous quarters may not be 
comparable to the current period.   

As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on individuals’ journeys 
within `r dataset_choice` will be reported.  

## Variables Reported

See the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of terminology and derived values.  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):** A unique identifier allocated to new referrals 
to a consultant led service, to enable identification of patient pathways. These 
are only unique *within* NHS boards. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Community Health Index (CHI) / Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):** The [Community 
Health Index (CHI)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html) 
is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. 
The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index, the first six digits 
of the CHI number relate to the person's date of birth (DD MM YY). Where CHI 
is not available, a locally-generated unique patient identifier (UPI) is used.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Sex:** Biological sex as recorded at birth. For the sake of reporting, the label 
'Not known' refers to indeterminate sex at birth, including intersex. The use of
'Not specified' refers to instances where the information is not available.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Age group:** Age in years is calculated at the point of referral from reported date 
of birth. When date of birth is not reported, the first six digits of the CHI 
number are used. Age is then grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.  

`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "CAMHS", "NB: records have not been removed from CAMHS on the basis of recorded age.", "")`
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**SIMD quintile:** [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/) 
is a postcode-derived measure of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as 
‘deprived’, this can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also 
mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area 
is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access 
to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode area does not 
necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences deprivation. Not all patients 
are treated in their NHS board of residence. Please note that NHS board areas may
not have all five quintiles represented.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral received date / Referral date:** The date on which a health or social 
care service receives a referral. If this cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is 
used instead as these dates are often very similar. If neither of these fields are
provided the individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within 
the time frame reported.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral accepted:** A categorical variable stating whether an individual's
referral has been accepted, or not accepted, where the label 'Other' refers to cases where the decision is pending or the information is missing.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance reason:** The reason why a referral was not accepted 
by the service provider. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance action:** The action taken following an initial referral 
not being accepted into the service. Please note that this is experimental data 
and can not be recorded in all NHS boards.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment date:** The date on which an appointment occurred or was planned 
to occur. **The first appointment date in an individual's pathway is referred to 
as the first contact appointment.**
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment attendance status:** Indicates whether the patient attended their 
appointment, and provides context for non-attendance. This is used to calculate
Did Not Attend (DNA) rates.
</Div>

# Results and Commentary
Suspendisse velit nisi, tempor ut posuere ut, blandit in mauris. 

## `r dataset_label_long` referrals

Table 1 shows the number of people referred to `r dataset_label_long`
recorded in CAPTND by quarter, for each regional Health Board and Scotland 
overall.  

For the quarter ending December 2023, there were a total of 27,071 individuals 
referred to PT services recorded in CAPTND. This is an increase of 1,284 (5.0%)
compared with the previous quarter, and an increase of 3,300 (13.9%) compared 
with the same quarter in the previous year.  

**pick out some trends**

CAPTND data are still at an experimental stage therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis should be treated with caution. See [Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section to explain differences between Official 
Statistics and CAPTND.

`r if(dataset_choice == "PT"){

"Psychological Therapies refer to a range of interventions, based on psychological concepts and theory, which are designed to help people understand and make changes to their thinking, behaviour, and relationships in order to relieve distress and to improve functioning. The standard applies specifically to psychological therapies for treatment of a mental illness or disorder."

"Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services provided by NHS Scotland. Services are provided by teams of clinicians including psychiatrists, mental health nurses, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists and other allied health professionals. These services are based mainly in outpatient clinics and in the community. CAMHS are multi-disciplinary teams that provide treatment and/or interventions for children and young people experiencing mental health problems. Where a child or young person is awaiting an assessment for a neurodevelopmental condition such as ASD, or ADHD, they may not be appropriate for CAMHS because they do not meet the National Referral Criteria as described in the CAMHS national service specification, and may instead be referred onto a neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway. This release does not report on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those children and young people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list.  

**Children and young people**  
The people served by CAMHS. Some areas provide services for all those under 18, 
while others offer services to those over 16 only if they are in full time education."

**Mean**  
The arithmetical average value i.e. total of a number of values / the total number of 
values.

**Median**  
The middle value when the data values in a dataset are ranked in increasing (or 
decreasing) order of magnitude.

**Total appointments** 
The total number of appointments recorded in CAPTND, whether attended or not. An 
individual can have more than one appointment in a given day.

**First contact appointment** 
The first appointment date that appears in an individual's care pathway.

**DNA Rate**
Did not attend (DNA) refers to first contact appointments in which a patient did 
not attend and gave no prior warning. The DNA rate is the proportion of first 
contact appointments for which this occurs out of all first contact appointments.
