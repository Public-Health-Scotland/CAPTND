# Introduction

This publication of statistics in development presents information relating to 
activity in `r dataset_label_long` `r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", "services", "")`
from the Child, Adolescent, and Psychological Therapies National Dataset (CAPTND), 
at NHS board and Scotland-level. Here ‘Scotland-level’ refers to the aggregated
regional NHS board figures that are available in CAPTND.  

CAPTND is a dataset in development that collates information for mental health 
services at patient-level and records each individual’s journey through the service. 
CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis should be treated with caution.  

This report relates to the period `r date_label_15m` to `r date_label`.  

## Data Quality

Good quality data is crucial for accuracy and interpretation, and Public Health 
Scotland is working with all NHS boards to implement robust data collection for 
CAPTND. Some data items, namely ‘UCPN’, ‘UPI’, and ‘CHI’, are required to create 
a unique and complete care pathway for an individual within CAPTND (see 
[Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section below). For records where these variables 
are not available, the pathway cannot be created and is therefore not counted 
in the CAPTND dataset. A comparison of referral counts before and after pathway 
creation can be found in the [CAPTND Quality Assurance](#captnd-quality-assurance) 
section below.  

Data returns for CAPTND began in June 2019, and following extensive data quality 
checking and collaboration with NHS boards data quality improved sufficiently by 
January 2020 to enable reporting to commence thereafter. Improving data quality 
in CAPTND is an ongoing process, meaning data from previous quarters may not be 
comparable to the current period.   

As the development of CAPTND progresses, greater detail on individuals’ journeys 
within `r dataset_choice` will be reported.  

## Variables Reported

See the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of terminology and derived values.  

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Unique Care Pathway Number (UCPN):** A unique identifier allocated to new referrals 
to a consultant-led, nurse-led, or other service, to enable identification of patient pathways. These 
are only unique *within* NHS boards. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Community Health Index (CHI) / Unique Patient Identifier (UPI):** The [Community 
Health Index (CHI)](https://www.datadictionary.nhs.uk/attributes/community_health_index_number.html)
is a population register, which is used in Scotland for health care purposes. 
The CHI number uniquely identifies a person on the index, the first six digits 
of the CHI number relate to the person's date of birth (DD MM YY). Where CHI 
is not available, a locally-generated unique patient identifier (UPI) is used.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Sex:** Biological sex as recorded at birth. For the sake of reporting, the label 
'Not known' refers to indeterminate sex at birth, including intersex. The use of
'Not specified' refers to instances where the information is not available.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Age group:** Age in years is calculated at the point of referral from reported date 
of birth. When date of birth is not reported, the first six digits of the CHI 
number are used. Age is then grouped into 5-year age categories for reporting purposes.  

`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "CAMHS", "NB: records have not been removed from CAMHS on the basis of recorded age.", "")`
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**SIMD quintile:** [Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD)](https://www.gov.scot/collections/scottish-index-of-multiple-deprivation-2020/) 
is a postcode-derived measure of relative deprivation. If an area is identified as 
‘deprived’, this can relate to residents having a low income, but it can also 
mean fewer resources or opportunities. SIMD looks at the extent to which an area 
is deprived across seven domains: income, employment, education, health, access 
to services, crime and housing. Residence in a deprived postcode area does not 
necessarily mean an individual themselves experiences deprivation. Not all patients 
are treated in their NHS board of residence. Please note that NHS board areas may
not have all five quintiles represented.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral received date / Referral date:** The date on which a health or social 
care service receives a referral. If this cannot be provided, ‘Referral date’ is 
used instead as these dates are often very similar. If neither of these fields are
provided the individual’s record cannot be counted as it cannot be placed within 
the time frame reported.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral accepted:** A categorical variable stating whether an individual's
referral has been accepted, or not accepted, where the label 'Other' refers to cases where the decision is pending or the information is missing.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance reason:** The reason why a referral was not accepted 
by the service provider. 
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Referral non-acceptance action:** The action taken following an initial referral 
not being accepted into the service. Please note that this is data under development
and can not be recorded in all NHS boards.
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment date:** The date on which an appointment occurred or was planned 
to occur. **The first appointment date in an individual's pathway is referred to 
as the first contact appointment.**
</Div>

<Div custom-style = "Bullet 1"> 
**Appointment attendance status:** Indicates whether the patient attended their 
appointment, and provides context for non-attendance. This is used to calculate
Did Not Attend (DNA) rates.
</Div>

# Results and Commentary

Improving our mental health is recognised as an important aspect of public health.
Accessing mental health services is becoming more common overall and this is
reflected in the total referrals to `r dataset_label` `r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", " services", "")`
in Scotland recorded in the CAPTND dataset which have increased for this most recently 
reported quarter compared to the same quarter in the previous year. For the quarter
ending `r date_label`, there were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt` individuals
referred to PT, compared to `r figs_referrals$last_yr` in the quarter ending
`r date_label_yr`.

Here we present, for the first time, detail on the outcome of those referrals to
`r dataset_label` which are recorded in CAPTND. In this most recently reported quarter,
the referral acceptance rate was `r table_data2[[15,6]]`. Of those referrals that
were not accepted, we also present the reason for non-acceptance and the subsequent
action taken by the NHS board.

In addition to referrals, we are also able to present for the first time detail
on the number of appointments occurring in `r dataset_label`
`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "PT", " services", "")` in Scotland. In the latest quarter,
there were `r figs_apps[[1,1]]` appointments in Scotland overall. Of these, `r figs_apps[[1,2]]`
were first contact appointments, and for `r figs_apps[[1,4]]` of those first
contact appointments the patient Did Not Attend (DNA). We also present detail on
the DNA rate trend over time, and the impact of relative deprivation on the DNA rate.

## `r dataset_label_long` referrals

Table 1 shows the number of people referred to `r dataset_label_long`
recorded in CAPTND by quarter, for each regional Health Board and Scotland 
overall.  

For the quarter ending `r date_label`, there were a total of `r figs_referrals$current_qt`
`r ifelse(dataset_choice == "CAMHS", "children and young people", "individuals")` 
referred to `r dataset_choice` recorded in CAPTND. This is 
`r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_qt > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r figs_referrals$diff_qt` (`r figs_referrals$prop_qt`%) compared with the previous quarter, 
and `r ifelse(figs_referrals$diff_yr > 0, "an increase", "a decrease")` of 
`r figs_referrals$diff_yr` (`r figs_referrals$prop_yr`%) compared with the same 
quarter ending `r date_label_yr`.  

**pick out some trends?**

For some boards referral numbers may appear to have climbed sharply over the past
5 quarters, which is reflective of improved data quality of submissions allowing
more pathways to be counted in CAPTND, rather than necessarily reflecting an actual
increase in service demand.  

CAPTND data are still under development therefore any inferences or 
conclusions from this analysis should be treated with caution. See 
[Variables Reported](#variables-reported) section to explain differences between 
Official Statistics and CAPTND.

## `r dataset_label_long` referral acceptance

Table 2 shows referral acceptance rates recorded in CAPTND in the latest quarter, 
for each regional health board and Scotland overall.  

The referral acceptance rate for Scotland overall in the quarter ending 
`r date_label` was `r table_data2[[15,6]]` (`r table_data2[[15,2]]` accepted referrals).

3. "Other" refers to pending referrals as well as not-known referral outcomes
<br>

Figure 1 shows the reported reason for referral non-acceptance in Scotland overall
for the quarter ending `r date_label`. In `r dataset_choice` it is clear that the
primary reason for referral non-acceptance is recorded as '`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]]`'
`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[1,4]] == "Unsuitable", "- meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred", "")` (`r ref_rej_reasons[[1,7]]`%). The next most common reason
for referral non-acceptance is recorded as '`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]]`'
`r ifelse(ref_rej_reasons[[2,4]] == "Unsuitable", "- meaning that the patient is unsuitable for the service to which they have been referred", "")` (`r ref_rej_reasons[[2,7]]`%). **include examples**  

Please note that this is data under development and not all NHS boards are currently 
able to record this information – which accounts for the high proportion of 
referrals where non-acceptance reason was ‘Not recorded at board level’.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 1: Reasons for non-accepted referrals, NHSScotland, quarter ending `r date_label`</Div>
```{r Non-acceptance reason chart, fig.width=7.18, fig.height=3.31, fig.cap="Appropriate ALT Text to be added.", include = TRUE}

```
<br>

Figure 2 shows the actions taken by services following referral non-acceptance in
Scotland overall for the quarter ending `r date_label`. Again, it is important to
note that some NHS boards are not able to record this information at the present
time.  

For the records for which a non-acceptance action can be recorded, however, 
it is clear that the majority of individuals are '`r ref_rej_actions[[1,4]]`' 
(`r ref_rej_actions[[1,7]]`%), or  '`r ref_rej_actions[[2,4]]`' (`r ref_rej_actions[[2,7]]`%), 
meaning the individual is given further information on where to seek help.

```

## `r dataset_label_long` appointment attendance

Table 3 shows the total appointments made within `r dataset_label_long` recorded 
in CAPTND by quarter, for each regional health board and Scotland overall, and the 
number of those appointments which were first contact appointments. In Scotland 
overall, there were `r figs_apps$"Total appointments"` appointments in the latest quarter, 
of which `r figs_apps$"1st contact appointments"` (`r figs_apps$prop_first_con`%) 
were first contact appointments.  

The Did Not Attend (DNA) rate is an important measure to consider, as DNA appointments
are difficult to fill due to the unplanned nature of the non-attendance (see 
[Glossary](#glossary) section for more information). As the DNA rate is for first
contact appointments, this also represents a delay to treatment start time. The 
DNA rate for Scotland overall in the latest quarter was `r figs_apps$"1st contact DNA rate"`%, 
representing `r figs_apps$"1st contact DNA"` of `r figs_apps$"1st contact appointments"` 
first contact appointments.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Table 3: Total and first contact appointments in `r dataset_choice` by health board, with DNA rate for first contact appointments ^1,2^</Div>

<br>

Figure 3 shows the DNA rate over the last 15 calendar months, for each health board 
region (see [Glossary](#glossary) 
section for more information).  

There is some evidence for regional variation in DNA rate, though within region 
the DNA rate seems fairly stable over time. NHS boards in the East region appear 
to experience fewer DNA first contact appointments than those in the West region, 
with the North region sitting in between them.  

<Div custom-style = "Table or chart caption">Figure 3: First contact DNA rate by health board region, 15 months up to `r date_label`</Div>

```
<br>

Figure 4 shows the first contact DNA rate for Scotland as a whole in the quarter 
ending `r date_label`, broken down by SIMD quintile (see [Variables reported](#variables-reported) 
section for more information).  

There are many factors which may influence the DNA rate, of which relative deprivation
is one. It appears from figure 4 that relative deprivation can affect the DNA rate
in a dose-dependent manner, with individuals from the most deprived areas
(`r figs_dna_simd[[1,10]]`%) more likely to DNA a first contact appointment than
those from the least deprived areas (`r figs_dna_simd[[5,10]]`%).

```

## CAPTND quality assurance

The CAPTND dataset relies upon CHI / UPI and UCPN identifiers in order to accurately
track an individual’s care pathway in `r dataset_label_long`. In the absence of
these identifiers, the care pathway cannot be counted in CAPTND.  

Table 4 presents a comparison of total referral counts in `r dataset_label_long`
submitted to CAPTND, against the number of those pathways which can be counted
using the identifiers. This is broken down by individual health board, and for
Scotland overall, for the quarter ending `r date_label`.  

For Scotland overall, `r figs_basic_opti$"Percent difference"` of submitted referral
pathways could not be counted in CAPTND. At the level of NHS boards, however,
this varies considerably with several boards having all of their referral pathways
counted in CAPTND. In health boards for which the retention is lower, this tends
to be due to issues around recording of the required identifiers, which we expect
to improve over time with ongoing data quality assessment and development.

This release does not report on the neurodevelopmental (ND) pathway including those children and young people on the neurodevelopmental waiting list.  

**Children and young people**  
The people served by CAMHS. Some areas provide services for all those under 18, 
while others offer services to those over 16 only if they are in full time education."
